How We See Ourselves and How We See Others
==========================================
Article *How we see ourselves and how we see others*, in *Science* [#]_ looks at cognitive bias in how people judge themselves and their own behaviour compared to those of others'. The bias are formed because person's experience of themselves is created by their sensations, emotions and cognitions, but their experience of others is dominated by what they can observe externally.

The article points out that this behaviour is systematic and predictable, and rooted in the basic processes of human perception.


My Thoughts, Your Behavior
--------------------------
This article section reviews five examples of the reasons for the differences in perception of self versus others

#) Positive illusions
#) Interpersonal knowledge
#) Pluralistic ignorance
#) Miscommunications
#) Conformity


I’m Objective, You’re Biased
----------------------------
This section of the article illustrates how people tend to assume that the information coming through their perception directly reflects what is true, and when there perceptions are challenged by others' peoples faith in their own subjectivity often prompts them to views others as biased.


Origins of the Difference
-------------------------
This sections discusses about origins of the self-other difference. It makes a case about the origins having roots in the human development. Article points out that infants show greater difference, but through interaction and maturation, difference gets smaller, yet some of it may persist.


Self and Other in the Brain
---------------------------
The article section discusses the neuroscience behind the self-other difference. Experiments have shown that specific regions in human brain are involved when perceiving themselves with other. Specifically *media prefrontal cortex (mPFC)* have been shown to activate. Monkeys have been shown to possess mirror neurons that fire both when they perform an action and when they perceive another perform the same action.


The Self in Time
----------------
According to the article, people also treat their past and future selves as though they are other people. One of the reasons given for why this happens is because people cannot introspectively access those selves' thoughts and feelings. Also neuroscientific evidence is pointed to support this by suggesting that different regions of the brain is activated when thinking past and future selves compared to present.
