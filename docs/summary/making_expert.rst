Making of an Expert
===================
Harward Business Review's article, *The Making of an Expert*, [#]_ discussed how to become an expert, what is considered an expert and the common misconceptions about becoming an expert.


Made not Born
-------------
The article makes an strong case that experts in any field are always *made not born* and the journey of becoming an expert is a product of years of deliberate practice requiring struggle, sacrifice, and honest self-assesment.


What is an Expert
-----------------
According to the article, real expertize must pass three tests:

1) Expertize must lead to performance that is consistently superior to that of expert's peers.
2) Expertize must produce concrete results.
3) Expertize must able to be replicated and measured in the lab.

It is pointed out that difficulty of measuring a expertize depends on the field, and for example sports are easier to measure in comparison to other professions.


Deliberate Practice
-------------------
Article says that becoming an expert is not just simply a result of practising daily for year or decades but about how you practice and only deliberate practice, meaning specifically practising things you can't do well instead of practising what you can already do well, can make you an expert. Also deliberate thinking is required.


Amount of Practice
------------------
Article points out to research that says it takes minimum of ten year (10 000 hours) of intense training to reach skill level to win international competitions and in some fields even more. It claims that because the bar in international level of expertize has steadily risen since 19th century, nowadays it is almost impossible to beat the ten-year rule.


Coaches and Mentors
-------------------
Achieving expertize is heavily dependent on the quality of practising, which is usually achieved by having practising supervised by assistant or teacher.

Real experts seek out coached who can give them constructive feedback, and they understand when the advice is working for them.
